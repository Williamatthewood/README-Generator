  ## Description
  
  This application uses node.js to provide a short series of prompts at the command line. Upon filling in those responses, the application creates a formatted README with fields for a project title, description, installation and testing information, licensing information, and how to contribute and ask questions. From there, developers can edit it however they need to for their project. The README is also set up with markdown syntax, so it is ready to be viewed on platforms like GitHub.
  

  ## Installation 
  
  ```
  npm i
  ```
  

  ## Usage
  
  From the root directory, after installing dependencies using npm, simply run node index.js and answer the prompts for the README to be generated.
